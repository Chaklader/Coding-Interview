# Contributing to the Repository

We’re excited to have you contribute to this repository, and your efforts will be fully credited! Whether you want to add solutions in a new programming language or improve existing ones, here’s how you can get started:

1. Let me know what you plan to contribute! The best way to do this is by joining our Discord server (see page 2 of the book). Communication is important to prevent you labouring on a set of quesitons that someone's already working on.

2. Once you've been approved, **fork the repository** to start working on your own solutions locally.

3. Take a close look at how the Python solutions are organized. Your contributions should align with this structure (e.g., folder organization, file naming). 

4. Always **create a new branch** for your additions or changes. We recommend creating separate branches for each chapter you’re contributing. Example: `git checkout -b java-solutions-linked-lists`.

5. Stay true to existing variable/function naming, code comments and algorithm structure. If imports are necessary for the code to run, include them. Don't wrap the code around a class unless it's mandatory for the language, or the problem necessitates a class. Feel free to add additional comments for clarity, especially if any language-specific nuances are included. 

6. **Test your code**. Be sure your code runs. We're currently working on making all test cases public. In the mean time, please use your own set of diverse test cases.

7. **Open a pull request** (PR) and clearly describe your work in the PR. Respond to comments and make necessary adjustments when requested. Once approved, your PR will be merged!
